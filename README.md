## Requeriments

- NodeJS with NPM 
- HTML5 web browser


## Getting Started 

### Installing dependencies

You can install all dependencies listed in `package.json` with

```$ yarn install```

or 

```$ npm install```

### Running the development server

To run the development server simply type: 

```$ npm start```

And the server will develop at `localhost:3000`

## Building
 ``` $ npm run build```

  or

```$ yarn build```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles app production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.
